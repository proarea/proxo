# Proxo

A simple tic-tac-toe game, yet developed as a corporate app.

## Aim

This project is aimed to show the correct way to create and distribute Flutter apps.

It follows corporate guidelines and contains the least amount of bugs.

Most of the screens are responsive and adapt to both portrait and landscape orientation.

The app supports four languages:
- English
- Ukrainian
- Japanese
- Polish
- Russian
- French
- Spanish
- Turkish

VS Code IDE was used, and all the necessary tasks are automated and stored inside the `.vscode/tasks.json` file.
